Hello, I am Muhammad Azeem Ahsan, a final-year student pursuing BS in Computer Science at PUCIT.
I am currently immersed in my final year project, where we are using Django and React to create an ecommerce platform.
Specifically, my focus is on developing the frontend.
I have a strong passion for development and enjoy crafting user-friendly interfaces.
In addition to my academic pursuits, I've gained practical experience through an internship at CodeSoft.
Apart from this, I have a strong passion for problem-solving, and I am eager to contribute my skills
